#
# Global Group Secret File
# group: all
#
# Common secrets to be used across all groups. These will be overridden
# if they are defined in any other group, or host file.
#
# Each variable in this file corresponds to a variable in the "vars" file
# without the "vault_" prefix.
#
# This file should be encrypted using Ansible Vault when not editing.
# This file is loaded and before any other file in this directory, thus
# this file will be decrypted in memory by Ansible Vault and its contents
# made available for use elsewhere in the project. For more information
# on Ansible Vault and variable precedence, see the official
# Ansible documentation.
