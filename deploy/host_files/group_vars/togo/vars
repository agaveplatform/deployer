# Group Variable File
# group: togo
#
# Default group variables for all the inventory in this group.
# All sensitive information should be stored in a 'vault'
# file within this same directory. The file should have
# corresponding variable names prefixed with "vault_".
#
# The vault file will be decrypted at runtime by ansible-vault
# and the vaules used to initialized this file. Any other
# values can be overridden using Ansible's standard variable
# precedence. For more information see the offical documentation:
