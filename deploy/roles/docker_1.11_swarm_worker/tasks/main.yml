# Creates a Docker 1.11 swarm worker by joining an existing cluster. Requires CentOS on OpenStack.
# NOTE: this role is not currently idempotent! We will eventually be moving to the latest Docker module within Ansible.
#       All containers will first be REMOVED unless setting -e remove_conatiners=False
#
# Pre-requisites:
# 1. Each node in the swarm cluster is on a private network with ports available. Private IPs must be provided for each node.
# 2. Each node has the docker_host role (-e update_docker_version=True -e update_docker_compose_version=True -e docker_version=1.11.2-1.el7.centos)
